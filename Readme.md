# Introduction

This project is inspired by this [work](https://github.com/ecohydro/covid-19-waves).  

We currently detect the number of people that appear outside in key areas of Stockholm and Goteborg at the same time.   
The more people are next to each other in the same space, the more likely Covid-19 will spread across the Swedish population. 

# Our Goals 
Our main goal is to convince people to say home with key statistics. 

We focus now in Sweden but feel free to raise an issue with ideas in your country.   

Remember: 
### STAY SAFE, STAY HOME!
