# COVID-19 Dashboard

This is a simple dashboard to keep me off twitter during the next few weeks. I probably should have picked a more uplifting project, but this one could be useful. 

Main goals are to re-learn muscle memory around plotly's Dash library, generate some informative data visualizations, and provide code for others to modify and use as interested.

I will try to document things in a series of notebooks, although it's a little hard to demonstrate working code for Dash in a notebook environment.
